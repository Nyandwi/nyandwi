### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jean de Dieu Nyandwi. I am broadly interested in machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and the intersection of vision and language.

I previously worked at VIEBEG Ltd as a data scientist after my internship there and taught deep learning with TensorFlow at The Python Academy.

I designed a comprehensive [machine learning package](https://github.com/Nyandwi/machine_learning_complete/) that contains over 32 end-to-end and interactive notebooks on various topics such as data analysis, data visualization, data cleaning, classical learning algorithms, and deep learning for visual recognition and natural language processing.
