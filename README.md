### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jean de Dieu Nyandwi. I am broadly interested in Machine Learning and Computer Vision. My interests lie in the intersection of both education and engineering. I am currently teaching Deep Learning with TensorFlow at The Python Academy. 


### Professional Certifications

Here are the courses that I have took: 

* [TensorFlow Developer Certificate - Google](https://github.com/Nyandwi/nyandwi/blob/main/professional%20certificates/Jean%20-%20TensorFlow%20Developer%20Certificate.pdf)
* [Advanced TensorFlow Techniques - DeepLearning.AI, Coursera](https://github.com/Nyandwi/nyandwi/blob/main/professional%20certificates/Jean%20-%20TensorFlow%20Advanced.pdf)
* [TensorFlow In Practice Specialization - DeepLearning.AI, Coursera](https://github.com/Nyandwi/nyandwi/blob/main/professional%20certificates/Jean%20-%20DeepLearning.AI%20TensorFlow.pdf)
* [TensorFlow: Data and Deployment](https://github.com/Nyandwi/nyandwi/blob/main/professional%20certificates/Jean%20-%20TF%20Specialization%20Certificate.pdf)

* [AI for Everyone - DeepLearning.AI, Coursera](https://github.com/Nyandwi/nyandwi/blob/main/professional%20certificates/Jean%20-%20AI%20For%20Everyone%20Certificate.pdf)
* [Data Science and Machine Learning BootCamp - Jose Portila](https://github.com/Nyandwi/nyandwi/blob/main/professional%20certificates/Jean%20-%20DS%20and%20ML%20Bootcamp%20Full.pdf)
* [Computer Vision with OpenCV and Deep Learning - Jose Portila](https://github.com/Nyandwi/nyandwi/blob/main/professional%20certificates/Jean%20-%20Udemy%20Computer%20Vision.pdf)

I achieved other certifications in various data domains such as Data Visualization (Tableau and Power BI), Edge AI, SQL, Business, etc...

### Technical Skills

* I have an extensive experiences in building Deep Learning models with TensorFlow
* I love coding Convolutional Neural Networks (aka Convnets)
* I like to visualize dataset at hand. I use Python Data Visualization tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly. I have also analyzed big data with Tableau and Power BI. 
* Other tools that I find helpful day to day: OpenCV, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and NumPy. 

### Community

* I actively write about Machine Learning at my [blog](https://jeande.tech) - These articles are also published in [Medium - Analytic Vidhya](https://jeande.medium.com)
* I host PIE & AI Kigali meetups - I have hosted 3 events so far with ML practioners from all part of the world - [Records are on my Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSPFIgLyc2t-pNim-CdyBNQ/videos)
* I am active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Jeande_d) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nyandwi/). 


Outside tech, I enjoy playing basketbal :basketball:
