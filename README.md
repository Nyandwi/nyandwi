### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jean de Dieu Nyandwi. I am broadly interested in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision.

- I design machine learning educational content. I designed [Complete Machine Learning Package](https://github.com/Nyandwi/machine_learning_complete) and [Modern Convolutional Neural Network Architectures(ModernConvNets)](https://github.com/Nyandwi/ModernConvNets).
- I occasionaly write [articles](https://nyandwi.com/blog) about machine learning and latest techniques and trends in deep learning.
- I am launching [Deep Learning Revision](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/deeprevision) newsletter. Deep Learning Revision will highlight and dive deep into latest news, ideas, and techniques in deep learning and computer vision.

- I am best reached via [email](mailto:johnjw7084@gmail.com). I am also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Jeande_d), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nyandwi/), [Medium](https://jeande.medium.com), and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSPFIgLyc2t-pNim-CdyBNQ).
