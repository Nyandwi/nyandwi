I achieved other certifications in various data domains such as Data Visualization, Edge AI, SQL, and project managements.

### Technical Skills
* I have a broad understanding of Machine Learning concepts, algorithms and best practices.
* I have an extensive experiences in building Deep Learning systems with TensorFlow.
* Other skills: Image processing, data cleaning, and data visualization.
* Currently improving skills in: Machine Learning Operations (MLOps). 

### Community

* I actively write about Machine Learning at my [blog](https://jeande.tech) - These articles are also published in [Medium - Analytic Vidhya](https://jeande.medium.com).
* I host PIE & AI Kigali meetups in parternship with [DeepLearning.AI](https://deeplearning.ai) - I have hosted 3 events so far with ML practioners from adifferent sides of the world - Recordings are available [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSPFIgLyc2t-pNim-CdyBNQ/videos).
* I am active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Jeande_d) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nyandwi/).


Outside tech, I enjoy playing basketbal :basketball:
